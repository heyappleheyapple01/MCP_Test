 Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard that defines a structured
    way to exchange and manage contextual information for machine learning
    models, AI systems, and language models. MCP aims to facilitate
    interoperability between tools, platforms, and services by providing a clear
    specification fcopor how context—such as prompts, conversation history, and
    environmental data—can be packaged, transferred, and processed.

    ## Key Features
    - **Interoperability:** Enables different model providers, clients, and
    middleware to communicate contextual data in a consistent way.
    - **Extensibility:** Designed to accommodate diverse use-cases by supporting
    custom and application-specific context fields.
    - **Portability:** Makes it easy to transfer state between systems, improve
    reproducibility, and facilitate debugging.

    ## Use Cases
    - Standardizing interaction protocols between chatbots, virtual assistants,
    and orchestration frameworks
    - Sharing and saving sessions or conversations for later retrieval or
    analysis
    - Simplifying tool and plugin integration for complex workflows
